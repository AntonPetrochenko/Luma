The goal of this project is to create a highly extensible Minecraft Classic server.

Luma is not meant to be a competitor to MCGalaxy. My idea behind Luma is "what if Minecraft Classic continued development as it's own game?" What I saw in it is potential for customizability. Looking back, Notch himself toyed with the idea of Lua scripting. The extensions that the community had developed along the way create potential for a powerful, albeit quirky, platform for creating mini-games, kind of like Roblox. There are ways of almost completely redefining the appearance of the game, while still being confined to the style of Minecraft.

So, the general idea is to not implement "Minecraft Classic 0.30" per se, as other servers do, but rather to create a platform on which "game modes" defined outside of the server can run.

Similarly to how Minetest is split into "minetest" and "minetest game" (+ a thousand other games) - an engine and a game built on top it, Luma is going to be split into "Luma" and "Luma Freebuild" (+ many more game modes made by you!)

This project also intends to "backport" some later-game technical features into Classic, such as entities (...really?) and block states (redstone? eh, don't count on it)
